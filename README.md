# Word Frequency List Representation
An undergraduate final year project experimenting with DAWGs (Directed Acyclic Word Graphs) as a  representation for word-frequency lexicons. 
Space and time complexity is optimised as much as possible using both the DAWG and encoding methods. 
This project has been carried out with the purposes of a spell checker in mind.
